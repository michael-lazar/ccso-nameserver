# Features you want enabled
#
# PRE_ENCRYPT	Passwords kept encrypted.  This allows a user to use his
#		cleartext password elsewhere safely should the database
#		be compromised, but provides no added security to qi.
# ID_FALLBACK	If no password, use last 8 chars of id field
# DO_TILDE	field~value means field is empty or contains value
# FWTK_AUTH	Use the auth server from the Trusted Information Systems (TIS)
#		Firewall Toolkit (FWTK).  This authentication server supports
#		the Digital Pathways SNK/4 and SecureId authenticator cards,
#		S/Key, as well as re-useable passwords.  This requires prior
#		installation of the authsrv program and access to the FWTK
#		libraries.  Obtain it from
#		ftp://ftp.tis.com//pub/firewalls/toolkit/fwtk.tar.Z
#		Also required in the fwtk directory is the libdes.a library
#		(*NOT* the same as libdes.a from v4 Kerberos!).  Obtain this
#		libdes.a package from ftp://ftp.psy.uq.oz.au/???
# KRB4_AUTH	Use Kerberos v4 authentication.  See also KRBHERO, KRB4SRVTAB,
#		KRBNSREALM, and KDB
# KRB5_AUTH	Use Kerberos v5 authentication.  See also KRBHERO, KRB5SRVTAB,
#		KRBNSREALM, and KDB
# KDB		Propagate alias add, change, and delete commands to a V5
#		Kerberos database.  Must run as root user.
# EMAIL_AUTH	Allow authorization by email field
# CLEAR_AUTH	Allow authorization by clear-text passwords (big-time lose
#		from a security point of view, however some clients are too
#		brain-dead to do challenge encryption.
# EMAIL_ANYOK	Any value is allowed for email field (even *@maildomain).
#		Leave it out and get the default behavior which disallows
#		setting an email address which ends in @maildomain.
# PASS_AUTH	Allow authorization by password field.
# RESTRICTED	Depreciated.  Make @OkAddrs non-empty for same function.
# SORTED	Sort entries before printing.
# NO_READ_LOCK	Do not lock for reading; helps on loaded systems, but
#		may give wrong results every once in a blue moon.
# CRACKLIB	Include Alec Moffett's cracklib library for extremely
#		thorough password checks.  We find it too thorough as it
#		disallows some pretty good passwords.  Requires prior
#		installation of the dictionary part of the package.
#		See vixen.cso.uiuc.edu:/pub/cracklib25.tar.gz

#		of a /etc/krb.realms file, krb_realmofhost() would return

# These string-valued things are overridable at runtime, by specifying
# (eg) qi -DATABASE=/some/dir/data .  Some explanation for the less 
# obvious ones
#
# DEFQUERY	Which field is searched by default when a query command
#		is given with no field name (e.g. "query paul pomes").
#		If undefined, this defaults to "query name=..." as in 2.2.
#		We use "query any=..." and have a number of fields defined
#		with the Wild (==fdAny -- sheesh!) attribute (alias, email,
#		name, nickname, oldname).
#
# KRBHERO	Kerberos hero instance ID (default phhero; we use a
#		different one).	 You must login using the hero
#		instance in order to actually become a hero -- in
#		addition to having a hero field.  Probably making
#		KRBHERO="" is reasonable for sites that don't care to
#		have separate hero and regular passwords.
#
# KRB4SRVTAB	Path for v4 Kerberos srvtab (default /etc/srvtab).  Qi needs
#		to know it's own password, but does not need to see root's,
#		so we use a /nameserv/db/srvtab which is readable by the
#		nameserv user.  Use this if inetd runs qi as a non-root
#		user or if $OtherDefines{"Use_Uid"} != 0 .
#
# KRB5SRVTAB	Path for v5 Kerberos srvtab (default FILE:/etc/v5srvtab).
#		Qi needs to know it's own password, but does not need to see
#		root's, so we use a /nameserv/db/v5srvtab which is readable
#		by the nameserv user.  Use this if inetd runs qi as a non-root
#		user or if $OtherDefines{"Use_Uid"} != 0 .
#
# KRB4SRV	The name of the service principal (default rcmd) to query for.
#		If qi is run as root, it can use the default rcmd principal.
#		Otherwise it should use a different name (the value of
#		NsService is a good choice) stored in a alternate srvtab file.
#		See KRB4SRVTAB.
#
# KRB5SRV	The name of the service principal (default host) to query for.
#		If qi is run as root, it can use the default host principal.
#		Otherwise it should use a different name (the value of
#		NsService is a good choice) stored in a alternate v5srvtab file.
#		See KRB5SRVTAB.
#
# MAILDOMAIN	Used by ph clients to re-format the email address.  If this
#		is not desired, comment out MAILDOMAIN completely.  This
#		must also be done if MAILBOX does not equal "email".
#
# MAILFIELD	Name of the mailfield returned by "siteinfo" (default alias).
#		If both MAILFIELD and MAILDOMAIN are defined, clients will
#		display email addresses consisting of the MAILFIELD field of
#		the entry, an "@", and the MAILDOMAIN value.
#		If MAILDOMAIN is not defined, clients will display email
#		address consisting only of the contents of the MAILFIELD
#		field of the entry.
#
# MAILBOX	This is the field where the user's maildrop is kept.  It
#		defaults to "email".  Older clients are unlikely to understand
#		if you change it from "email"; proceed with caution.
#
# CHARSET	Name of the character set to be used in queries and responses.
#		Values will be drawn from registered Internet character sets.
#		If omitted, it will be assumed to be iso-8859-1.
