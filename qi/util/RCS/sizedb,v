# sizedb - calculate size of database needed
#
# usage: sizedb config [files]
#
# Algorithm is
#
# Extract all the words from all Indexed fields.
# Throw away ones <2 characters or that begin with parens.
# Pipe through "sort | uniq | wc -l".
# This gives the number of words that will be indexed.
# Multiply that by 2 or so to get a comfortable table size.
# Print the next prime number greater than the calculated table size.
